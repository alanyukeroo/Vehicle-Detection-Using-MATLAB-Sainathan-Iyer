Detection and Counting of Vehicles in a Video Feed 



Detecting and counting cars can be used to analyze traffic patterns. Detection is also a first step prior to performing more sophisticated tasks such as tracking or categorization of vehicles by their type.

This example shows how to use the foreground detector and blob analysis to detect and count cars in a video sequence. It assumes that the camera is stationary. The example focuses on detecting objects. To learn more about tracking objects, see the example titled Motion-Based Multiple Object Tracking.
